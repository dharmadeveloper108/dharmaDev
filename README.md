# Personal website 

###### > DHARMADEVELOPER.COM

My personal website, made entirely with Vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

The navigation is handled through a faux terminal and CLI. `--info` to get a list of the available commands and their description (about, experience, projects).

The UI is like a simple desktop with draggable windows. The 'aesthetic' I went for is a mix of the current Apple's macOS terminal and Microsoft's Windows98 (the first OS I've ever used as a kid).
